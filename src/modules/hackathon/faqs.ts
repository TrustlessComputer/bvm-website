    q: 'Can I unstake $BVM?',
    a: `<p>Yes, you can unstake BVM at any time. Please note that your staked tokens will be released after a 21-day period. You can claim your tokens through the Staking Dashboard once the unstaking process is complete.</p>`,
  },
  {
    q: 'Why does it take 21 days to unstake?',
    a: `<p>The staking program is the first step to decentralize the BVM network further. The staked BVM will ensure the security of the upcoming products, like decentralized bridges and shared sequencers. A short unstaking period could compromise the security of these products. The best practice that weâ€™ve found from other networks is 21 days.</p>`,
